How to run our application:

To try out our application, we have included an apk which you can install onto your android device.
Find the apk at vanilla/build/outputs/apk/vanilla-debug.apk

Since our application relies on a web server, it might not work if the server has been taken down.
We will try to leave the server running untill the end of April in case anyone tries to use our
application. If the server is no longer running, we have included instructions on how to setup the server
and these instructions are found in vanilla/src/server/readme.txt
